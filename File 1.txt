Docker Labs
Run our first container 
  Image Naming convention of DockerHUB
  reponame:tag
 eg hello:world
hello-world is the name of repo
and there is no tag specified if no tag specified then the tag is latest
docker first check the image locally if present run the container if not present then it will check docker hub and find hello-worold public repo and download the image with latest tag locally and then run the container
Every docker image contains a default command that will be executed when you run the container using the image. if the command is  along running process then your container wll be in running state . if the command is a short running process it will start do its job and the process terminates and hence the container also exits
to list all running container
$ docker container ls 
To list all containers
$ docker container ls -a
Run container in interactive mode
docker container run --name test -it centos
you ar in container shell prompt
execute 
ps -ef
and see /bin/bash is the parent process having pid 1. if the parent process gets stoppeed the container slao exits
type exit
$ docker container ls -a
you will see the container exits
Run the container again
docker container run --name test1 -it centos
now insted of typing exit press CTRL+p+q at once and you wil coe out of the container prompt
$ docker container ls 
you will see the container running
if you want to to back to the container prompt then
$ docker container attach test1
exit from the container
exit
